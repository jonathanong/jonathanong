### Greetings!

I'm Jonathan Ong, a software engineering manager based in Los Angeles, CA.
When I have time, I help maintain [koajs](https://github.com/koajs).
Previously, I helped maintain [expressjs](http://expressjs.com/) and friends.

Currently, I'm focusing on people and project management and am an engineering manager at [Houzz](https://www.houzz.com/). 
I am not currently looking for a new position.
Even if I were, I would not be willing to relocate.

I am available for consulting, though I only have a few hours available per week.
Please email me if you're interested.

You can find me on the following slack groups:

- [Rands Leadership Slack](https://randsinrepose.com/welcome-to-rands-leadership-slack/)
- [LeadDev Slack](https://lead-dev-slack.herokuapp.com/)
- [js.la Slack](https://join-jsla-slack.herokuapp.com/)
