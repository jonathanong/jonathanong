### Greetings!

I'm Jonathan Ong, a software engineering manager based in Orange County, CA.
When I have time, I help maintain [koajs](https://github.com/koajs).
Previously, I helped maintain [expressjs](http://expressjs.com/) and friends.

Currently, I'm focusing on people and project management and am an engineering manager at [Houzz](https://www.houzz.com/). 
I am not currently looking for a new position.
Even if I were, I would not be willing to relocate.

I don't write often, but you can follow my blog at [medium/@jongleberry](https://medium.com/@jongleberry).

You can find me on the following slack groups:
